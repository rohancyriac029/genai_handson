            "2. If the string is empty or only contains one character, it returns the string as is (base case).\n",
            "3. If the string is longer than one character, it calls itself with the substring `s[1:]` (i.e., the string without the first character) and appends the first character `s[0]` to the result.\n",
            "4. This recursive process continues until the base case is reached, at which point the function starts returning the reversed string.\n",

            "#### Time Complexity\n",
            "The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it makes n recursive calls to reverse the string.\n",
